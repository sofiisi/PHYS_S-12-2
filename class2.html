	This weekend I learned to use the different tools that Fusion 360 offers. I started doing the screw because I find it the most detailed. I don't regret doing that because when I finished, I had already spent so much time in it that I knew where almost everything was. The other thing that I learn is that personally, for me, it is more comfortable to build each part of the component separately and then assemble them. In this way, I can pay attention to the details of the small pieces. On the other hand, I know I need to improve my abilities in preciseness using the tools the program offers, especially when the metric is variable.
