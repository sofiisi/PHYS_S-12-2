    To understand why I chose my final project you need to know a little bit about my story. I'm a Latin woman burn and race at the end of the continent, Chile. When I was 12 years old, I started to get interested in tech, and I had the opportunity to take a robotics class at the University of Chile. Back then, robotics and technology in Chile weren't a big thing in young people; just university students and professionals did it. After that, I apply for the team at the University (for high school students), and I got in. There I discover that tech and mechanics are my passion. However, I also realized code is not my favorite thing at all. I prefer, and I'm better at electronics. So after changing my project a few times and leave off my favorite thing (motors), I decided to make something with simple hardware but with complicated code.

    Summarizing, I love mechanics and I wanted to get outside my comfort zone. So that how YUDI was born. Originally YUDI was going to be an intelligent pen holder that would change color every time you get something in and out with an IR sensor. At the same time, another board would be connected via Bluetooth and would change the LED in my bedroom. I did a pre-project that you can see in detail <a href="../../class8/class8.html"><strong>here</strong></a>, but here is a video of how it worked.<br><br>

    I had already sent my 3D models to print when I change my mind. Luckily, my parts would also be useful.
