<h1>Circuit</h1>
<div class="paragraph">
	<p>
	I had to be honest and said that I built the real circuit first. I played around Tinkercad, and I didn't like it. I feel it was to slow for me. However, after I finished my circuit, I copied it to Tinkercad because I find it useful to show other people what I'm doing more clearly. I used a DC motor (a CC one in the Tinkercad), a 1K resistor, and a led. Well, and all the other basics materials. <br>
	What I learned so far is to recognize the cathode and the anode because I committed that mistake at least ten times. I understand how electricity ”moves” around the breadboard. How to use a potentiometer. How to not connect the wires and how to strip them. Because, despite my experience with electronics and Arduino, I had always used male to male jumper wires, so I had never striped one.<br><br>

	<strong>Multimeter:</strong> Finally, I used the multimeter to measure the voltage in the circuit. In connection with the board, I got 5.5V. Then in the potentiometer, I got 5.38V in the first leg, 3.01V in the middle one, and 0V in the last one. Sadly my multimeter decided not to work anymore, but I connect a wire to use the analog read. To get the measure in voltage, I divided by the power that the board provides, I learned it in the <a href="https://www.arduino.cc/en/Tutorial/ReadAnalogVoltage"><strong>Arduino website.</strong></a> It was confusing for me that the multimeter gave me values bigger than the power supply, so I believe it is a mistake. <br>

	<strong>The code:</strong> <br>
		<img src="anvcode.png" alt="code" style="width: 45%"><br>
	<strong>Potenciometer:</strong> 5V, 3.36V, 0V
	<strong>Motor:</strong> 4.49V
	<strong>Resistor:</strong> 3.37V (nearest to the potenciometer), 2,71V (the other side)
	<strong>Led:</strong> 2.70V, 0.4(cathode)
