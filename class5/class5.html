<h1>Programming Arduino</h1>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>First, I wanted to work with the circuit and Arduino because on Tuesday workshop; I had a  lot of problems connecting the button. I was so complicated with the two-leg button that I end up switching for a four one that I already knew how to connect and work with it. Doing that, I realized that wasn't a code problem that was a connection problem. <a href="https://electronics.stackexchange.com/questions/116971/what-is-the-difference-between-4-leg-and-2-leg-momentary-tactile-switch"><strong>I read this post</strong></a>, and I understand what I was doing wrong. I change my circuit, connect it write, and I realized that this kind of button is easier to use.</p>

<p>
So for the assignment, I wanted to challenge myself. My plan was to connect two LEDs, each one connected to a button. I connected everything, and I started playing with the code. I tried three ways, at the beginning I code two separate if one for led 1/button 1 and the other one led 2/button 2. Since that didn't work, I change for one if, in other words, the if was if button 1 was high and the else if bottom two was high. That didn't work either. Consequently, I change the code again for this one:</p>
<pre><code class="language-arduino">
  const int buttonPin = 2;   //button 1
const int buttonPin2 = 3;  //button 2 
const int led1 =  10;   //Led control by button 1
const int led2 =  11;   //Led control by button 2 
int ledbr = 255;

int buttonState = 0;   
int buttonState2 = 0; 

void setup() {
   pinMode(led1, OUTPUT);
  pinMode(led2, OUTPUT);
  pinMode(buttonPin, INPUT);
   pinMode(buttonPin2, INPUT);
}

void loop() {
  // read the state of the pushbutton value:
  buttonState = digitalRead(buttonPin);
  buttonState2 = digitalRead(buttonPin2);
  // check if the pushbutton is pressed.
  // if it is, the buttonState is HIGH:
if (buttonState == HIGH){
   for (int i = 0; i <= 255; i=i+1) {
    analogWrite(led1, i);
    delay(10);
  }
  delay(100);
  digitalWrite(led1, LOW);
  delay(10);
   }   
else if (buttonState == LOW);{
  buttonState2 = digitalRead(buttonPin2);
  if (buttonState2 == HIGH){
   for (int i = 0; i <= 255; i=i+1) {
    analogWrite(led2, i);
    delay(10);
   }   
  }
  else if (buttonState2 == LOW);{
    digitalWrite(led2, LOW);
    }
  }
// Added the delay
  delay(100);
}
</code></pre>
<p>Again, this code didn't code. I was running out of ideas, and I decided to use tinkercad with that I would realize something. My code actually worked perfectly in the simulation. I found that the LED 2 was burned. I rerun the program, and it partially works. 
  <video width="100%" controls>
       <source src="2led2b.mov" type="video/mp4">
    </video><br><br>

The only thing was that the LEDs didn't turn off after I stopped pressing the button. And I try several things, but I couldn't make it. My theory is that I'm not actually breaking the for, so the program never gets to the low point. I would actually code this in a <code>while</code> and with other methods but that wasnÂ´t part of the assignment.

  <strong>Desing with Fusion 360</strong><br>
  For the 3D design, I created a rack and a pinion with the idea that I would end up using them in my final project. When I was building it and thinking about the whole design, I realized that I was doing what I know how to do it. In every competition that I have participated, I worked in the robot design and construction, so I feel comfortable doing it. For that reason, I decided to change my final project to something that I haven't work in off yet. Anyways this is the <a href="https://knowledge.autodesk.com/support/fusion-360/learn-explore/caas/screencast/Main/Details/a7992d99-5d4d-48c2-b971-a86ba3014608.html"><strong>tutorial</strong></a> that I used is from Autodesk, and even though they use an older version of fusion is easy to follow. And this is the design I come up with:
