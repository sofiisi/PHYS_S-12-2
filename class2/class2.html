<h1>3D model in Fusion 360</h1>

<p><strong>Screw</strong><br> 
	I had a lot of problems with the screw because IÂ´m perfecctionist. So I wanted to see every detail. I build the base first doing the large cilinder, the small cillinder, and the hole. Then I used the thread tool but before discovering I tried doing each line with the excrute. This last tool I used to create a third cilinder with the circular pattern to do the small lines.

<br><strong>Micro servo motor</strong><br> 
	With this piece I just wanted to play arround with moving thing with precision. So I divided in 5 parts, build them and then attachment together.

	This weekend I learned to use the different tools that Fusion 360 offers. I started doing the screw because I find it the most detailed. I don't regret doing that because when I finished, I had already spent so much time in it that I knew where almost everything was. The other thing that I learn is that personally, for me, it is more comfortable to build each part of the component separately and then assemble them. In this way, I can pay attention to the details of the small pieces. On the other hand, I know I need to improve my abilities in preciseness using the tools the program offers, especially when the metric is variable.
